And this is fine &ndash; being conscious of your human nature is\n  a good thing, and hopefully it will guide you toward a career you will enjoy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  There is one thing though - nobody will nor can decide for you in the end. A\n  better approach at rapidly finding a career you enjoy is the following:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Learn broadly and constantly about many topics to form a deep view of the\n    world you live in: psychology, philosophy, politics, engineering,\n    mathematics, physics, arts, history, etc.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Find what problems are important to you and the people around you as your\n    learning about the world progresses.\n  </li>\n  <li>Determine the skills needed to fix these problems and acquire them.</li>\n  <li>\n    Connect with people interested in solving the same problems you want to\n    solve.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    With your courage, patience, and self-directedness, be willing to try and\n    actually fix the problems you care about, and try to surround yourself with\n    critical but empowering influences wanting you to succeed.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Self-directedness toward fixing the problems that matter to you with people\n  sharing your view is your only path to having a career that will be meaningful\n  to you in the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Don't waste too much time listening to other people's opinions. In the matter\n  of career choices, do your own thinking.\n</p>\n",
