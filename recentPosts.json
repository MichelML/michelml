        "post": "<p>\n  If you google this question online, you will find that this question has been\n  answered multiple times.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  I bet many people will provide you with specific answers with a detailed\n  explanation on how these professions fit your personality, skills,\n  temperament. And this is fine &ndash; being conscious of your human nature is\n  a good thing, and hopefully it will guide you toward a career you will enjoy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  There is one thing though - nobody will nor can decide for you in the end. A\n  better approach at rapidly finding a career you enjoy is the following:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Learn broadly and constantly about many topics to form a deep view of the\n    world you live in: psychology, philosophy, politics, engineering,\n    mathematics, physics, arts, history, etc.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Find what problems are important to you and the people around you as your\n    learning about the world progresses.\n  </li>\n  <li>Determine the skills needed to fix these problems and acquire them.</li>\n  <li>\n    Connect with people interested in solving the same problems you want to\n    solve.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    With your courage, patience, and self-directedness, be willing to try and\n    actually fix the problems you care about, and try to surround yourself with\n    critical but empowering influences wanting you to succeed. Self-directedness\n    toward fixing the problems that matter to you with people sharing your view\n    is your only path to having a career that will be meaningful to you in the\n    end.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n  Don't waste too much time listening to other people's opinions. In the matter\n  of career choices, do your own thinking.\n</p>\n",

Young, a clinical psychologist, professor at Columbia University,\n  and inventor of Schema Therapy and the term lifetraps, wrote extensively about\n  these rigid traits, namely in his book\n  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Dr4Cty\" target=\"_blank\">Reinventing Your Life</a>,\n  in which he describes the origin of these type of traits, the way they\n  manifest, and how to have better control over these manifestations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  If you want to better understand your human nurture, how your past influences\n  your present personality, digging into Jeffrey E. Young&rsquo;s writings is a\n  very good starting point.\n</p>\n<p>Fairwell.</p>\n",
