He went on to live 5 years with friends but didn&rsquo;t really\nhave a bedroom (for Canadian standards) - it was more like a closet with a\nsingle bed in it. He convinced our friends to rent the closet for 200$/month.\nHis roommates were not entrepreneurs and were smarts in their own ways. They\nwere all progressing rapidly in their careers, while Leo was struggling to\nfind product-market fit with his idea for years.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, Leo was regularly stating he was making progress over these years,\nyet most people of his surroundings started questioning his plans right after\nyear 1. People tried to convince him to get back to an engineering job many\ntimes, tried to talk him into the fact he was becoming a bit crazy, were\nlaughing at him and thinking he was a joke, etc. Leo chose to keep at it\nregardless.\n</p>\n<p>\nLeo took a part-time job around year 3 to be able to continue on his\nentrepreneurial journey. Finally, he started earning money from his business\nduring year four and signed a huge deal during year five which instantly made\nhim the biggest earner of anyone in his group of friends. Even more beautiful,\na lot of our friends, including myself, were starting to use his service!\n</p>\n<p>Leo was not a joke anymore.</p>\n<p>\nFor anything that&rsquo;s hard, you never **really** know when you&rsquo;re\ngonna get there. Trust yourself and the process.\n</p>\n<img\nclass=\"responsive-img\"\nsrc=\"/static/success.jpg\"\nalt=\"Graphical representation of success\"\n/>\n",
