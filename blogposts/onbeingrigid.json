  "post": "<p>\n  The personality traits that are usually harmful are the ones that are too\n  <span style=\"font-style: italic\">rigid</span>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  By rigid, I mean traits you display in multiple scenarios as an unconscious\n  defense mechanism, that usually result in lasting and repeating negative\n  consequences for yourself or your relationships.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Jeffrey E. Young, a clinical psychologist, professor at Columbia University,\n  and inventor of Schema Therapy and the term lifetraps, wrote extensively about\n  these rigid traits, namely in his book\n  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Dr4Cty\" target=\"_blank\">Reinventing Your Life</a>,\n  in which he describes the origin of these type of traits, the way they\n  manifest, and how to have better control over these manifestations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  If you want to better understand your human nurture, how your past influences\n  your present personality, digging into Jeffrey E. Young&rsquo;s writings is a\n  very good starting point.\n</p>\n<p>Fairwell.</p>\n",
