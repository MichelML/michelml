  One of the greatest thing in life is the feeling of succeeding at something
  after having struggled miserably for a significant period of time.
</p>
<p>I have a close friend, Leo.</p>
<p>
  Leo chose to quit his 6 figure engineering job to start a company around the
  age of 24. He went on to live 5 years with friends but didn&rsquo;t really
  have a bedroom (for Canadian standards) - it was more like a closet with a
  single bed in it. He convinced our friends to rent the closet for 200$/month.
  His roommates were not entrepreneurs and were smarts in their own ways. They
  were all progressing rapidly in their careers, while Leo was struggling to
  find product-market fit with his idea for years.
</p>
<p>
  However, Leo was regularly stating he was making progress over these years,
  yet most people of his surroundings started questioning his plans right after
  year 1. People tried to convince him to get back to an engineering job many
  times, tried to talk him into the fact he was becoming a bit crazy, were
  laughing at him and thinking he was a joke, etc. Leo chose to keep at it
  regardless.
</p>
<p>
  Leo took a part-time job around year 3 to be able to continue on his
  entrepreneurial journey. Finally, he started earning money from his business
  during year four and signed a huge deal during year five which instantly made
  him the biggest earner of anyone in his group of friends. Even more beautiful,
  a lot of our friends, including myself, were starting to use his service!
</p>
<p>Leo was not a joke anymore.</p>
<p>
  For anything that&rsquo;s hard, you never **really** know when you&rsquo;re
  gonna get there. Trust yourself and the process.
