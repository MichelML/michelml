<p>
  I'll be an amazingly loving father, but I fear my parenting days because of
  housekeeping.
</p>
<p>
  Vacuuming, doing the dishes, doing the laundry, folding, cooking, cutting
  grass, bathroom cleaning, preparing lunches, making the bed, keeping things
  tidy, etc.
</p>
<p>I'm one of the worst at almost all of the above.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Marie Kondo will save me by then.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed.</p>
