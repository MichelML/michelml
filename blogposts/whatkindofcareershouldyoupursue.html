  However, nobody will nor can choose for you in the end. Here is an approach
  that will lead you to <span style="font-style: italic;">choose</span> a career
  that adds meaning to your life:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Learn broadly and constantly on many topics. Psychology, philosophy,
    politics, engineering, mathematics, physics, arts, history, etc. It will
    help you form a broad view of the world you live in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find the problems that are important to you and the people around you. As
    your view of the world expands, do not hesitate to change course along the
    way.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determine the skills needed to fix the problems you want to solve and
    acquire them. Persevere.
  </li>
  <li>
    Connect with people interested in solving the same problems you want to
    solve.
  </li>
  <li>
    With courage, patience, and self-directedness, be willing to try and fix the
    identified problems. Again, try to surround yourself with critical but
    empowering influences wanting you to succeed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Self-directedness toward fixing the problems that matter to you, with the
  right people besides you, is your only path to having a meaningful career.
</p>
<p>
  Don't waste too much time listening to other people's opinions. In the matter
  of career choices, do your own thinking and experiencing.
