<p>Lacking personality can mean a lot of things.</p>

<p>
  However, in my humble opinion, a common usage of the term lack of personality
  that hinders one&rsquo;s own well-being over the long term relates to
  personality repression.
</p>

<p>
  Personality repression means excessively complying and living one&rsquo;s life
  through the influence of other people&rsquo;s desires/opinions, ignoring
  one&rsquo;s own. Not having a sense of self-expression and self-directedness
  for one&rsquo;s own life, always referring to what other people are doing to
  figure out what to do next for oneself.
</p>

<p>
  As a real-life example of that, you can imagine someone who radically changes
  her day-to-day behaviors every time she changes her life partner, whether it
  be a boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.
</p>

<p>Other real-life potential cues of personality repression:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A ridiculously high frequency of &ldquo;me too&rdquo; or similar statements
    in someone&rsquo;s conversation stance with another person.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drastic personality modification depending on the group a person spends time
    with. It can be in the way someone dresses, talks, thinks, eats, exercises,
    or any other manifestation of personality.
  </li>
  <li>
    A recurrent feeling of unease after saying yes to someone, when you really
    wanted to say no (or vice versa).
  </li>
</ul>

  Jeffrey Young talks about this concept in his book Reinventing Your Life, in
  which he discusses different lifetraps people can fall into that are usually
  developed through emotionally-charged past life experiences. The one that
  relates to personality repression in his book is called the subjugation
  lifetrap, as in subjugating to other people&rsquo;s needs and wants.
</p>
<p>
  I highly recommend his book if the concept of personality repression resonated
  with you, even if to a mild extent.
</p>

<p>Take good care.</p>
