Step by step, apply the fundamentals of programming in Clojure to build real-world, professional web applications. This edition features new libraries, tools, and best practices, and focuses on developing modern single-page applications. Stop developing web apps with yesterday's tools. Today, developers are increasingly adopting Clojure as a web-development platform. See for yourself what makes Clojure so desirable, as you create a series of web apps of growing complexity, exhibiting the full process of web development using a modern functional language. Journey through all the steps in developing a rich Picture Gallery web application--from conception to packaging and deployment.

Get up to speed on the many new libraries, tools, and best practices. Gain expertise in the popular Ring/Compojure stack using the Luminus framework. Learn how Clojure works with databases and speeds development of RESTful services. See why ClojureScript is rapidly becoming a popular front-end platform, and use ClojureScript with the popular Reagent library to build single-page applications. This book is for you, whether you're already familiar with Clojure or if you're completely new to the language. What You Need: The latest JVM, Clojure 1.6+, and the Leiningen build tool, as well as an editor such as Emacs, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Light Table, or VI.",
