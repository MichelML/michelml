What does neuroscience have to do with leadership? Everything. In Your Brain and Business: The Neuroscience of Great Leaders, Phillay discusses recent advances in brain science and neuroimaging and how they can dramatically improve the way leaders work with colleagues to drive successful change.

Now, with Pillay’s help, everyone can.",
