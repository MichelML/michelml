  I bet many people will provide you with specific answers with a detailed
  explanation on how these professions fit your personality, skills,
  temperament. And this is fine &ndash; being conscious of your human nature is
  a good thing, and hopefully it will guide you toward a career you will enjoy.
</p>

<p>
  There is one thing though - nobody will nor can decide for you in the end. A
  better approach at rapidly finding a career you enjoy is the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Learn broadly and constantly about many topics to form a deep view of the
    world you live in: psychology, philosophy, politics, engineering,
    mathematics, physics, arts, history, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find what problems are important to you and the people around you as your
    learning about the world progresses.
  </li>
  <li>Determine the skills needed to fix these problems and acquire them.</li>
  <li>
    Connect with people interested in solving the same problems you want to
    solve.
  </li>
  <li>
    With your courage, patience, and self-directedness, be willing to try and
    actually fix the problems you care about, and try to surround yourself with
    critical but empowering influences wanting you to succeed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Self-directedness toward fixing the problems that matter to you with people
  sharing your view is your only path to having a career that will be meaningful
  to you in the end.
</p>
<p>
  Don't waste too much time listening to other people's opinions. In the matter
  of career choices, do your own thinking.
