<p>
  You want. Wanting invites either stagnation or unhabitual change.
</p>
<p>Stagnation implies pain.</p>
<p>Unhabitual change implies pain.</p>
<p>
  Stagnation implies an unconscious, visceral, long-lasting, deferred,
  potentially explosive pain leading to the absolute certainty of an unfulfilled
  want.
</p>
<p>
  Unhabitual change implies a conscious, acute, ephemeral, likely mind-expanding
  pain leading to the potential fulfillment of your want.
</p>
<p>
  Being conscious of these two types of pains and their outcomes makes the
  choice between stagnation and unhabitual change obvious.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Through courage to endure pain of unhabitual change, living your best life
  becomes more likely.
