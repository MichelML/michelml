<p>
  The personality traits that are usually harmful are the ones that are too
  <span style="font-style: italic">rigid</span>.
</p>

<p>
  By rigid, I mean traits you display in multiple scenarios as an unconscious
  defense mechanism, that usually result in lasting and repeating negative
  consequences for yourself or your relationships.
</p>

<p>
  Jeffrey E. Young, a clinical psychologist, professor at Columbia University,
  and inventor of Schema Therapy and the term lifetraps, wrote extensively about
  these rigid traits, namely in his book
  <a href="https://amzn.to/2Dr4Cty" target="_blank">Reinventing Your Life</a>,
  in which he describes the origin of these type of traits, the way they
  manifest, and how to have better control over these manifestations.

<p>
  If you want to better understand your human nurture, how your past influences
  your present personality, digging into Jeffrey E. Young&rsquo;s writings is a
  very good starting point.
