He went on to live 5 years with friends but didn&rsquo;t really\n  have a bedroom (for Canadian standards) - it was more like a closet with a\n  single bed in it. He convinced our friends to rent the closet for 200$/month.\n  His roommates were not entrepreneurs and were smarts in their own ways. They\n  were all progressing rapidly in their careers, while Leo was struggling to\n  find product-market fit with his idea for years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  However, Leo was regularly stating he was making progress over these years,\n  yet most people of his surroundings started questioning his plans right after\n  year 1. People tried to convince him to get back to an engineering job many\n  times, tried to talk him into the fact he was becoming a bit crazy, were\n  laughing at him and thinking he was a joke, etc. Leo chose to keep at it\n  regardless.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Leo took a part-time job around year 3 to be able to continue on his\n  entrepreneurial journey. Finally, he started earning money from his business\n  during year four and signed a huge deal during year five which instantly made\n  him the biggest earner of anyone in his group of friends. Even more beautiful,\n  a lot of our friends, including myself, were starting to use his service!\n</p>\n<p>Leo was not a joke anymore.</p>\n<p>\n  For anything that&rsquo;s hard, you never **really** know when you&rsquo;re\n  gonna get there. Trust yourself and the process.\n</p>\n<img\n  class=\"responsive-img\"\n  src=\"/static/success.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Graphical representation of success\"\n/>\n",

        "post": "<p>Lacking personality can mean a lot of things.</p>\n\n<p>\n  However, in my humble opinion, a common usage of the term lack of personality\n  that hinders one&rsquo;s own well-being over the long term relates to\n  personality repression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Personality repression means excessively complying and living one&rsquo;s life\n  through the influence of other people&rsquo;s desires/opinions, ignoring\n  one&rsquo;s own. Not having a sense of self-expression and self-directedness\n  for one&rsquo;s own life, always referring to what other people are doing to\n  figure out what to do next for oneself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  As a real-life example of that, you can imagine someone who radically changes\n  her day-to-day behaviors every time she changes her life partner, whether it\n  be a boyfriend, girlfriend, etc.\n</p>\n\n<p>Other real-life potential cues of personality repression:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    A ridiculously high frequency of &ldquo;me too&rdquo; or similar statements\n    in someone&rsquo;s conversation stance with another person.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Drastic personality modification depending on the group a person spends time\n    with. It can be in the way someone dresses, talks, thinks, eats, exercises,\n    or any other manifestation of personality.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    A recurrent feeling of unease after saying yes to someone, when you really\n    wanted to say no (or vice versa).\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Jeffrey Young talks about this concept in his book Reinventing Your Life, in\n  which he discusses different lifetraps people can fall into that are usually\n  developed through emotionally-charged past life experiences. The one that\n  relates to personality repression in his book is called the subjugation\n  lifetrap, as in subjugating to other people&rsquo;s needs and wants.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I highly recommend his book if the concept of personality repression resonated\n  with you, even if to a mild extent.\n</p>\n\n<p>Take good care.</p>\n",
